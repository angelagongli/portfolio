            <p>A warm and virtual welcome to you! My name is Angela Li, and the purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase a number of projects selected from my work. The daughter of a physics post-doc at A&M-turned-programmer, I’m perhaps fittingly an ex-transfer pricing analyst now enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at UT. Its curriculum covers a full stack, meaning that my work in this program consists of developing applications utilizing both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
            <p>I’ve met a couple programming languages in the past: Java in high school computer science class, Racket and C in the introductory computer science sequence at the University of Chicago, and a host of other languages including R and Stata in the economics major coursework. Of course, I’ve also written my fair share of VBA in the office. I love to solve problems with code! (Read: I love when my code works.) This fact became apparent to me even as I didn’t major in the subject, in college. Now, bugs aside, I am happy to be coding all the time!</p>
