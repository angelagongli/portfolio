# Portfolio

## Description
This website is a portfolio showcasing a number of project chosen from my work. It also provides some basic background information about me, and enables online visitors to leave a message via contact form.

The website consists of three separate pages:
* [About Me](https://angelagongli.github.io/portfolio/index.html): a brief introduction to who I am
* [Portfolio](https://angelagongli.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html): displays a collection of projects selected from my work
* [Contact](https://angelagongli.github.io/portfolio/contact.html): a contact form for online users to type and submit a message

## Credits
The background image used on each page of this website was taken from the free library of patterns at [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/).

The images used in the various project cards shown on the Portfolio page were sourced from the following websites:
* https://buffalobayou.org/
* https://www.presentationmagazine.com/
* https://www.lifehacker.com.au/
* https://unsplash.com/ (photos by [Cassiano Psomas](https://unsplash.com/@psomas?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) and [Tom Thain](https://unsplash.com/@tthfilms?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText))

The sticky footer featured at the bottom of each page was made possible by following [this tutorial](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/) by Philip Walton.

The design and styling of the pages was inspired by, and indeed, required by, the Coding Boot Camp at UT.
