# Portfolio

## Description
This website is a portfolio showcasing a number of projects from my work. It also provides some basic background information about me, and enables online visitors to leave a message via contact form.

The website consists of three separate pages:
* About Me: a brief introduction to who I am
* Portfolio: displays a collection of projects from my work
* Contact: a contact form for online users to type and submit a message

## Credits
The background image used on each page of this website was taken from the free library of patterns at [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/).

The design and styling of the pages was inspired by, and indeed, required by, the Coding Boot Camp at UT.
